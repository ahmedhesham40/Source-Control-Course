Branch Basics
=================
# List all branches (local)
git branch

# List all branches (local + remote)
git branch -a

# Create a new branch (but stay on current one)
git branch <branch_name>

# Switch to a branch (Git 2.23+)
git switch <branch_name>

# Older way to switch branches
git checkout <branch_name>

# Create and switch to a new branch
git switch -c <branch_name>
# or
git checkout -b <branch_name>
===================
Branch Management
====================
# Rename current branch
git branch -m <new_name>

# Delete a branch (only if fully merged)
git branch -d <branch_name>

# Force delete branch (even if not merged)
git branch -D <branch_name>


======================
Remote Branches
======================
# Push branch to remote
git push origin <branch_name>

# Track a remote branch locally
git checkout -b <branch_name> origin/<branch_name>

# Delete a remote branch
git push origin --delete <branch_name>

# Fetch all remote branches
git fetch --all

==================
# See last commit on each branch
git branch -v
